A simple login page screen, i think that's a good project to a beginner

You can acess the page with the following link: https://mthslnk-gthb.github.io/LoginPage/login.html 

*The project doesn't have password characters requirements(0-9  a-z  A-Z, etc)

*I tried to add a recaptcha, but is so complex to a beginner like me because the keys and other things, so i removed it

*The login button redirects the user to the youtube page, just to have something after the login
